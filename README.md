# Virtual Rock Scissors Paper Game

Rock Paper Scissors Roadmap 
============================================================

A virtual version of rock scissors paper! Two players compete by choosing an option and comparing their choices. The game is win, lose or draw - the loser loses a life. Keep playing until one player has no lives left to live.

Steps:

Player 1 chooses rock, scissors or paper ( 1 of 3 options)
Player 2 (AI) chooses rock, paper or scissors ( 1 of 3 options)
Compare the 2 choices - iterate through until you find a win, lose or tie. 
Remove life from the loser
Displays a message/file count per cycle
End the game when a plate roses all their lives
Give an option to quit
Repeat the entire sequence until somebody wins

Considerations:
Create functions where appropriate to control programming flow
Try to DRY out your code as much as possible ( Don’t repeat yourself)
“Decorate” the text where appropriate for good UX/UI => basic because it’s just text
